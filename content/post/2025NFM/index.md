I am General Chair of the 17th NASA Formal Methods Symposium ([NFM 2025](https://shemesh.larc.nasa.gov/nfm2025/)) that will be held at the University of William and Mary (Williamsburg, VA, USA) June 11-13, 2025. Submissions are due on December 13, 2025.<br>
The NASA Formal Methods Symposium is a forum to foster collaboration between theoreticians and practitioners from NASA, other government agencies, academia, and industry, with the goal of identifying challenges and providing solutions towards achieving assurance for such critical systems. The focus of this symposium is on formal techniques for software and system assurance for applications in space, aviation, robotics, and other NASA-relevant critical systems.<br>
Topics of interests include but are not limited to:
- Advances in Formal Methods – Formal verification, model checking, and static analysis; interactive and automated theorem proving; program and specification synthesis, code transformation and generation; run-time verification and test case generation; techniques and algorithms for scaling formal methods; design for verification and correct-by-design techniques; requirements generation, specification, and validation.
- Integration of Formal Methods – Use of ML techniques in formal methods; integration of formal methods and software engineering; integration of diverse formal methods techniques; integration of formal methods with simulation, analysis, and test approaches.
- Formal Methods in Practice – Experience reports on applications of formal methods in industry; use of formal methods in education; applications of formal methods to concurrent and distributed systems, human-machine systems, autonomous systems, and fault-detection, diagnostics, and prognostics systems.
