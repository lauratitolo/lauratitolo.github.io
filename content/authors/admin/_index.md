#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me
I am a Principal Research Scientist at [Code Metal](https://www.codemetal.ai/) working on applying formal methods to improve the reliability of code transpilation techniques for edge computing applications.
Previously, I was a Lead Research Scientist for the Safety-Critical Avionics Systems Branch at [NASA Langley Research Center](https://www.nasa.gov/langley) and member of the NASA Formal Methods team.
I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the [University of Udine](https://www.uniud.it/en/uniud-international?set_language=en) (Italy) in May 2014. My PhD thesis was in part carried out at the Technical University of Valencia (Spain).
I earned a Bachelor’s and a Master’s degree in Computer Science from the University of Udine, both received with full marks and honors (summa cum laude).

My research focuses on different aspects and applications of formal methods.<br>
At <b>NASA</b> I was developing new tools for the formal verification and analysis of safety-critical avionics applications. In particular, I developed and applied rigorous techniques for improving the reliability of airspace software involving finite-precision computations.
I was the main developer of the [PRECiSA](https://github.com/nasa/PRECiSA) round-off error static analyzer for floating-point programs and the [ReFlow](https://github.comnasa/reflow) floating-point C code extractor. 
In addition, I contributed to different PVS libraries for structured natural language requirements, hybrid systems' verification, and temporal logics.<br>
At <b>Code Metal</b> I am applying formal verification techniques to improve the quality of automatically transpiled code for edge computing. 
 
I am an active member of the formal methods and programming languages communities, and I have served as program committee chair and member in several international conferences.
