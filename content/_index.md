  #       My research focuses on different aspects and applications of formal methods.<br>
  #       At <b>NASA</b> I was developing new tools for the formal verification and analysis of safety-critical avionics applications. In particular, I developed and applied rigorous techniques for improving the reliability of airspace software involving finite-precision computations.
  #       I was the main developer of the [PRECiSA](https://github.com/nasa/PRECiSA) round-off error static analyzer for floating-point programs and the [ReFlow](https://github.com/nasa/reflow) floating-point C code extractor. 
  #       In addition, I contributed to different PVS libraries for structured natural language requirements, hybrid systems' verification, and temporal logics.<br>
  #       At <b>Code Metal</b> I am applying formal verification techniques to improve the quality of automatically transpiled code for edge computing.
