title: "PRECiSA"
summary: "PRECiSA is a static analyzer that estimates the accumulated round-off error of floating-point programs.<br> It automatically generates PVS proof certificates that guarantee the correctness of
the error estimations with respect to the floating-point IEEE-754 standard. It is designed to support a compositional static analysis of the program and it support a large variety of operators and program constructs."
