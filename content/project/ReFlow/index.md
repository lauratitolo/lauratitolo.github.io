title: "ReFlow"
summary: "ReFlow extracts floating-point C code from a PVS real numbers specification.
The code is annotated with ACSL pre- and post-conditions that bound the accumulated round-off error.<br>
ReFlow can also instrument the C code to detect when the floating-point control flow diverges with respect to the ideal real numbers' one.
